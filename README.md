# Perceptron
A fundamental structure of Neural Netwroks i.e. a Neuron/Perceptron

## What's perceptron?
a computer model or computerized machine devised to represent or simulate the ability of the brain to recognize and discriminate.

## Reason to create?
It's great fundamental project anyone can create on Neural networks. Since I'm interested in research part of Artificial Intelligence it's a great learning project to do everything from scratch.
And purely Mathematical and Technical. 

## Libraries I used?

I used numpy and mathematics haha! Nothing fancy as long as you're not creating Tensorflow or Pytroch something. Then you'll need bit C/C++ and more math :)
